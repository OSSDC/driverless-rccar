# DRIVERLESS CAR

## Introduction

This project based on Sebantian Thrun's [Artificial Intelligence for Robotics
Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-for-robotics--cs373).
Having taken the course, I decided to build my own Arduino-based self-driving RC car.
Please also see my [driverless-car-notes](https://github.com/gokhanettin/driverless-car-notes) repo
where you can find my [jupyter-notebook](http://jupyter.org/) notes on the subject.

## Testing

I use [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org/) to develop the software.
Following items are required to get the software running:

- RC car with servo steering
- [Speed sensor](https://brainy-bits.com/tutorials/speed-sensor-with-arduino/)
- Arduino UNO

Speed sensor should be installed on the shaft. You should modify [definitions.hpp](src/definitions.hpp)
for your settings.
